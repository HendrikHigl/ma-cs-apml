    "# Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Genomic Ancestry\n",
    "\n",
    "Genomic data offers invaluable insights into human and animal migration patterns and ancestry, making it a powerful tool for reconstructing history of the world populations. In this project we will analyse genotype data that has been collected from individuals across multiple continents using two latent variable technigue: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We will see how both methods can inform on geographical location and ancestry of an individual. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will perform analysis on human genotype data from the [1000G project](https://www.internationalgenome.org/). There are multiple dataset available on this ressource, and data preparation can take a large amount of time. We will thus start with a table of selected genotypes provided on the [ancestry_viz github page](https://github.com/hagax8/ancestry_viz). The working tables are provided together with the notebook and were obtained by considering a set of 1976 individuals that were analysed in the [1000G project landmark article](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15393) and filtering sequence variations according to their diversity based on population genetics models (more details are available on the [corresponding ancestry_viz wiki](https://github.com/hagax8/uGTM/wiki/Appendix:-Generate-ancestry-files)). \n",
    "\n",
    "The project will be divided into different tasks:\n",
    "1. Data loading and visualization of the properties of the variations\n",
    "2. Application of PCA to the genotype matrix \n",
    "3. Presentation of the LDA model and application to 1000G data"

    "SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) are variations at specific DNA positions where a single nucleotide differs among individuals, serving as important genetic markers for researching human diversity and disease associations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some SNPs that directly influence a phenotype are known to correlate with geographical ancestry. A famous example is the difference in proportion of the SNPs related to lactose intolerance accross different populations. You can have a look at real data on this subject with this [short tutorial](https://genome.ucsc.edu/training/education/lactase.html). However those cases are rather more the exception than the norm. If one part of genome analysis are concerned the understanding of how a given combination of SNPs can influence characteristics of an individual, a more general question is only concerned how SNP patterns change across populations.\n",

    "In the following we will be only looking at the changes in SNPs proportion accross different individuals and see how one can use this information to predict the population of an individual. \n"

The table is further processed to include only SNPs occuring in a sufficient proportion (more than 2% of the population) and where the proportion of heterozygous alleles follows [Hardy-Weinberg principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy%E2%80%93Weinberg_principle) on each chromosome. \n",

    "The data consists of 1976 individuals (rows) and 39,182 SNPs (columns). Recall that human genomes are diploid (two copies of each chromosome) so there are always two alleles for one position. Thus each cell has 3 possible values:\n",
    "- 0: both allele are the same as the one on the reference genome (`REF`)\n",
    "- 1: both alleles are the alternative allele (`ALT`)\n",
    "- 2: We have an heterozygous allele with one ref and one alt  (`HTZ`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The annotation consists in 4 columns:\n",
    "- `id`: the individual ID\n",
    "- `1000G population code`: the 1000G population code (total: 20)\n",
    "- `population`: The population in a readable form\n",
    "- `1000G superpopulation code`: a superpopulation code (total: 5)\n",
    "  - `AFR`: African\n",
    "  - `AMR`: Admixed American\n",
    "  - `EAS`: East Asian\n",
    "  - `EUR`: European\n",
    "  - `SAS`: South Asian\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Questions:**\n",
    "- First plot an histogram of the proportion of `ALT` and `HTZ` accross indiviuduals and depending on the superpopulation. \n",
    "  - Do we observe a difference in the proportion of heterozygous or alternative allele depending on the superpopulation. \n",
    "  - How would you explain this effect?\n",
    "- Like for the regression project, we have to deal with missing data. We will be replacing them with the **median** values observed in for each column. \n",
    "  - Report the number of columns with missing data and their counts. \n",
    "  - Use the `fillna` method from pandas to replace the missing value by their median.\n"

    "In this task we will be applying PCA to the matrix of SNPs and see how the genotype is dispersed according to the geographical location of the subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform the PCA, we will use the `sklearn` environnment. Before applying PCA, it is usually advised to scale it according to the mean and standard deviation (you can use the `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` method for that). You can then construct a `sklearn.decomposition.PCA` object and apply its `fit` method to obtain principal components and results.\n",

    "  - How many components are able to capture most of the linear effects in the data? \n",
    "  - What is the cumulative proportion of the variance then explained? \n",
    "  - Would you say that PCA is a good dimension reduction technique? \n",
    "- Plot the first principal components as pairplots, what do you observe in terms of separation of the superpopulations on the first components? \n",
